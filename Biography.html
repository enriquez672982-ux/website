                    <p>Juan Enriquez (born 2003, Michigan) is a multimedia artist involved in many different media including music production, video production, graphic design and web design. He is also really involved in physical art such as drawing, painting and sculpting. He has been involved with art, specifically drawing and painting since he was little. In other words, he doesn’t remember when art wasn’t part of his life.</p>
                        
                    <p>He earned his certificate in computer science from Dodge City Community College in May 2022 and later completed his associates of science degree in May 2024. Eventually, since he had already transferred over to Fort Hays State University, he received his bachelor’s degree in computer science in July 2025. He is currently working towards completing some undergraduate credits in art in order to be able to complete his art master’s degree over in Fort Hays State University and he hopes to graduate within 2 or 3 years with it. He hasn’t quite chosen which master’s to go for but it will definitely be an art one though!</p>
                        
                    <p>When it comes to recent works, Juan has had a lot of them! He has designed many different album covers for the albums that he records at his church. You can find these examples in the Art Gallery tab in this same website. He has also gone into making entire album music videos and some mini sculptures of instrumentalists back in September for some of his friends.</p>
                        
                    <p>Lastly, why does Juan create art? It’s his PASSION! He really enjoys creating things and adding his own ideas and creativity to them.</p>
